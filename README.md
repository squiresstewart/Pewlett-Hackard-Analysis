# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis



## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this employee database analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
using SQL queries and commands. 



## Results: 

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed
- 90,398 current employees are expected to retire soon
- 63% of retiring employeesare senior level positions 

- 1,549 employees are eligible to be mentors in the mentorship program
- 48% of retiring Senior Engineers can be replaced via internal promotion.
- 43% of the retiring Senior Staff can be replaced via internal promotion.


## Summary: 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, 
then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
63% of retiring employees are senior level positions
- 29,414 are Senior Engineer positions
- 28,255 are Senior Staff positions

Based upon mentor requirements we can see that there is a lack of mentors needed per positions Senior Engineers 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
