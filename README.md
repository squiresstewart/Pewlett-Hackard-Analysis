It is clear that Pewlett-Hackard has a considerable shift in staffing. The analysis not only reveals staffing losses, but it also reveals how much payroll each department will be absorbing into their available budgets which will help to better the plan staffing changes. The inevitable loss of staff might provide a perfect 
opportunity to redistribute payroll capital between failing departments which will minimize expenses and increase profits in those areas.

In conclusion, the Pewlett-Hackard company should implement more agressive hiring programs in addition to a mentorship program. Considering promoting from within the company will place more skilled tenured employees in senior level positions. Those employees might need less mentoring as they are already familiar with company roles and expections. This will open up lower level positions to new hire candidates which places risk and costs to train at position levels that hold less stake.
